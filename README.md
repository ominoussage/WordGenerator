# WordGenerator
Python program that generates a pronouncable word. Choose your first letter and word length.

The program follows a rule of alternating between a vowel letter and a consonant letter.
Because of this, the program might generate an invalid word (buv, gic, tiy, etc.), but that is not the intention of this program. The main goal is only for it to alternate between a vowel and a consonant, producing a somewhat pronouncable word.

NOTE: This is just a fun little program. Nothing serious.
